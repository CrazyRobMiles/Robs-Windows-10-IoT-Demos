# Windows IoT Demos

These are two Windows IoT demos that I created for the Insider Dev Tour 2019

## Emotion Recognition
This is a modified version of the Cognitive Services example that accepts input from a webcam rather than loading an image from the web. It works on a Raspberry Pi or on your desktop. Which I think is rather impressive. Don't forget to add the address and key for your Cognitive service to the code. 

## Logo Blaster

This is a deeply silly device I made a while back that allows you to use a portable video projector (ideally a battery powered one) and a Raspberry Pi to project windows logos onto anything you fancy. The images that are displayed can be controlled by buttons that are connected to GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. You can find the source and also the STL files if you want to print your own version.

Have fun.
